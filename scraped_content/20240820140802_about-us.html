Our Commitment

Nationwide. Veterans. Lawyers.

The staff at the law firm of Joseph M. Bochicchio, PLLC, is dedicated
to serving the needs of veterans who proudly and honourably served this
country. We are humbled by the opportunity to assist you.

Our staff consists of experienced attorneys and case managers who
understand both the law and the inner workings of the VA. We have one
simple mission: To be the best, most qualified, “results achieving team
of individuals that is fully committed to working with Veterans and
assisting them in their time of need.

We consult with Veterans on a variety of needs and on a daily basis. We
work with volunteer organizations and politicians and strive to fulfil
the unique niche of helping Veterans who have been denied benefits. We
aim to help you obtain them and cut through the “red tape” in the
application process to get you the disability income benefits you need
and deserve.

Many of our Veterans have been through the painful process of
paperwork, navigating a maze of laws, and filing what they feel is an
obvious case in which they should be compensated, only to wait what
seems like an eternity to find out they have been denied benefits or
paid at a lower rate than what they feel is justifiable given their
level of disability.

In short, the laws and regulations concerning Veteran’s disability
benefits are vast and complex. We know the law, and we know how to wade
through the red tape to build a convincing case that has high odds of
approval if benefits are warranted. We will fight for the rights of
worthy veterans.

Ultimately, many Veterans express the frustration of waiting an
eternity only to get denied. We are different as our consultation is
free. Let us show you why other veterans who have been just as
frustrated with the process are now enjoying their days free of
financial stress and knowing that they and their families will be
financially secure.

Contacting us costs you nothing. We are so confident in our proven
staff that we will get results for any veteran with a legitimate case
that has been denied—no matter who filed your case for you—that we have
no problem investing our time to help you. You have nothing to lose and
everything to gain. So call us today from anywhere in the nation to
schedule your free consultation.
