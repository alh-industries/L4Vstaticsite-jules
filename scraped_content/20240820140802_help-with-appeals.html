Help With Appeals

[33]Joe Bochicchio

Most Veterans aren’t advised that their appeal to the Board of
Veteran’s Appeals (BVA)is likely their “last bite” at the apple under
the new law, which funnels the vast majority of cases to the BVA for
final decision.  The key word here is “final”, as the new law prevents
countless appeals on the same claims from being heard again in an
effort to reduce backlog.  The process begins with the filing of form
10182, and the “appeals lane” that is chosen.  The form seems simple
enough, but danger lurks below the surface—choosing the wrong appeals
option can have a serious impact on the success of your case.  Rarely
do we choose the “direct review” option, which does not allow for the
submission of additional evidence in your case, since the vast majority
of cases lacked the appropriate evidence from the start.

Many Veterans file appeals to the BVA themselves (by filing form 10182
Notice Of Disagreement), or through a representative and don’t remedy
the reasons for denial and/or lack of evidence.    They rest on
evidence that has already been filed, which, in many cases, was scant
to begin with and was not adequate to “connect all the dots”.  The
Veteran’s worst nightmare comes true when they attend the hearing, and
still don’t have the necessary evidence, let alone the proper legal
argument to win their case, and received yet another denial after a
long wait for their hearing.

What your representative should be doing is working with you during the
entire time your case is waiting to be heard, and to guide you in
developing the additional evidence during the course of your wait
period, becoming intimately familiar with every aspect of the evidence
and legal argument to be made in your case.  The constant communication
gives us familiarity with your diagnoses and other evidence, the
in-service event or events that have caused your injury, and have not
only thoroughly reviewed, but directed our clients to go to doctors we
have vetted to provide expert medical opinions for many months prior to
the Board of Veterans Appeals hearing date.  The hearing, as I like to
say, is the big show.  What is most important about the “big show” is
all of the months of preparation that go into it—the intensive
preparations and details that are executed behind the scenes that ends
up in flawless performance.  The hearings generally last between 20
minutes and one hour, so it is critical to cover all the important
points and to have concise, well-prepared arguments and evidence and to
make effective, well-honed argument before the judge.  In short, we
hunt with a rifle.. not a shotgun.  We are looking for pinpoint
accuracy—not throwing a “kitchen sink” worth of evidence and argument
up against the proverbial wall, hoping something sticks.

It is IMPERITIVE to have an experienced, accredited attorney review
your file and develop a strategy for your case AS SOON AS POSSIBLE in
the appeals process.  This often requires obtaining additional
evidence, and filling gaps in the evidence that was submitted with the
claim that got denied.  Some of this evidence takes quite some time to
develop to ensure the best of all possible odds of winning your case in
front of the BVA judge, so it’s important that you contact a qualified
representative as soon as possible—especially in cases where your BVA
appeal has already been filed.

The additional evidence can involve lay statements (i.e. “buddy”
statements) , additional medical evidence, photographic evidence, and
solid legal argument that connects all the dots and turns your denied
claim into one that the judge can grant benefits for. It’s having the
right kind of evidence, combined with good legal argument that leads to
successful outcome of your case.

At our firm, we develop a comprehensive strategy to assist our clients
in gather all the necessary evidence, and to “preempt” what the judge
will be looking for in order to maximize the chances of a grant of
benefits.  This strategy development and execution of that strategy
doesn’t happen overnight, and cannot afford to wait until the last
minute, so it is exceedingly important to evaluate the weaknesses in
your case and why it was denied to begin with, and to connect all the
dots early on so that we are ready for hearing long before the hearing
date ever comes.

Why do Veteran’s lose their case at the BVA level?  Often times, it’s
for the same reasons that they lost the case at the Regional Office
level when they first applied.  It therefore makes zero sense to wander
into a case going before a judge, and not be any further along filling
all the holes and having developed sound legal argument before
appearing at the hearing.  It’s the old adage about doing the same
things, yet expecting a different result being the definition of
“insanity”.

The fact of the matter is that your BVA hearing serves only two
distinct purposes:
1. To get any personal testimony as to facts
    surrounding/supporting/corroborating your

Injuries or disease, and why it was caused by your active duty career
(i.e. “nexus”);
2. To make legal argument as to errors in fact or law that caused the
    VA to deny your claim to begin with.

Other evidence, such as buddy statements, your own personal (written)
statement, photographic evidence, nexus letters, stressors (for PTSD),
and competent medical evidence should have already been procured long
before your hearing, so they can be identified and cited as exhibits
that corroborate both your current diagnosis, as well as the fact that
your injury or disease were PROXIMATELY CAUSED by or during your active
duty military career.

If your case involves getting secondary conditions service-connected,
as is often the case, the medical evidence is even more critical to win
your case on appeal.

Our firm provides FREE, NO OBLIGATION consultations on your case.  Our
Veteran clients comment continuously on the fact that “we ask questions
that no one else has ever asked them”, and it becomes obvious that our
years of experience in handling Board of Veteran’s Appeals cases as to
the best strategy for their case.
