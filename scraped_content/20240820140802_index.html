Do You Feel like You’re Locked Out of Your Benefits?

​The VA Disability process can be extremely daunting.

The truth is, it is quite complicated. The difference between getting
the benefits you deserve or being “locked out” of the benefits, you
should be receiving is only a matter of knowing which key to use.

Our staff consists two case coordinators and two full-time attorneys
highly trained and experienced in Veterans’ Disability law.

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

PTSD can have many causes—whether from the stressors of being in the
theater of wartime activities including fear for one’s life or safety,
assault, or witnessing things that are an unfortunate fact of war:
dead, burned, or mutilated combatants or civilians, and even the
immense guilt of knowing that carrying out one’s duties resulted in
death or injury to other human beings. PTSD is VERY common among
service members, as being in the military exposes our service-members
to horrors of war. Let’s face it: Any military throughout history has
two purposes: To deter attacks on our homeland, assets, and allies, and
when efforts at deterrence are exhausted, to kill the enemy.

PTSD can manifest even several years after the incident or incidences
(the “stressors”) that caused it, and is known to get worse over time,
especially if left untreated.  PTSD can manifest in many ways,
including:
* Hyper-vigilance
* Disturbed sleep patterns, nightmares
* Suicidal or homicidal ideations
* Heightened startle response
* Avoidance of crowds, people and events that cause great aggravation
    and discomfort for the Veteran
* Strained family relationships
* Difficulty in relating and working with others, leading to
    disciplinary actions at work, and even to termination
* “Road Rage” and other events that may involve altercations with
    others including law enforcement

Many Veterans we talk to do not even know they are suffering from PTSD,
but their lives and relationships are crumbling all around them.

PTSD is a very REAL and debilitating condition often caused by the
Veteran’s active-duty service, and the VA will compensate you for your
suffering.

Once you have applied and been DENIED (or short-changed), the law firm
of Joseph M. Bochicchio, PLLC can take on your appeal and fight on your
behalf.  CALL NOW for a free evaluation of your PTSD claim to get you
the treatment and the money that you deserve.

PACT ACT

What’s the PACT Act and how will it affect my VA benefits and care?

The PACT Act is perhaps the largest health care and benefit expansion
in VA history. The full name of the law is The Sergeant First Class
(SFC) Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive
Toxics (PACT) Act.

The PACT Act will bring these changes:
* Expands and extends eligibility for VA health care for Veterans
    with toxic exposures and Veterans of the Vietnam, Gulf War, and
    post-9/11 eras
* Adds more than 20 new presumptive conditions for burn pits and
    other toxic exposures
* Adds more presumptive-exposure locations for Agent Orange and
    radiation
* Requires VA to provide a toxic exposure screening to every Veteran
    enrolled in VA health care
* Helps us improve research, staff education, and treatment related
    to toxic exposures

If you’re a Veteran or survivor, you can file claims now to apply for
PACT Act-related benefits.


What does it mean to have a presumptive condition for toxic exposure?

To get a VA disability rating, your disability must connect to your
military service. For many health conditions, you need to prove that
your service caused your condition.

But for some conditions, we automatically assume (or “presume”) that
your service caused your condition. We call these “presumptive
conditions.”

We consider a condition presumptive when it’s established by law or
regulation.

If you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to prove that your
service caused the condition. You only need to meet the service
requirements for the presumption.

The PACT Act also adds locations to the list of areas where exposure is
legally presumed.

Burn Pit Exposure

Burn pits, notably prevalent during the Gulf War cause respiratory
diseases:  Rhinitis, Sinusitis, Lung conditions, gastrointestinal
conditions, and certain cancers.  There are now over 20 conditions that
enjoy the legal presumption of being caused by exposure to toxic fumes
from burn pits under the PACT ACT, including the listed conditions
below.   This change expands benefits for Gulf War era and post-9/11
Veterans.

These cancers are now presumptive:
* Brain cancer
* Gastrointestinal cancer of any type
* Glioblastoma
* Head cancer of any type
* Kidney cancer
* Lymphatic cancer of any type
* Lymphoma of any type
* Melanoma
* Neck cancer of any type
* Pancreatic cancer
* Reproductive cancer of any type
* Respiratory (breathing-related) cancer of any type

These illnesses are now presumptive:
* Asthma that was diagnosed after service
* Chronic bronchitis
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Chronic rhinitis
* Chronic sinusitis
* Constrictive bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis
* Emphysema
* Granulomatous disease
* Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
* Pleuritis
* Pulmonary fibrosis
* Sarcoidosis

Military Sexual Trauma/Military Assault

It’s alarming how many MST cases our firm has handled.  You entrusted
your life to the military and your superiors to protect you and treat
you with fairness and respect.  Military Sexual Assaults are a complete
and total violation of that trust.  Trust can be further eroded when
MST incidents are reported through the appropriate channels, but then
never investigated, or the perpetrator is never punished.

With Military sexual trauma or assault, special handling of the case is
required under VA regulations to allow “circumstantial” evidence to
support the claims.  Generally, MST incidents have been “swept under
the rug” by superiors in many cases, and direct eyewitnesses are
generally rare, making these cases particularly hard to prove.

That being said, under the relaxed evidentiary standards, a skilled
lawyer with experience handling MST claims can assist in gathering the
appropriate evidence that, while circumstantial, can be used to
successfully prosecute your claim.  Joseph M. Bochicchio and his staff
are heavily experienced in handling MST claims for Veterans, and in
using the law to win cases.

If you have been assaulted (or sexually assaulted) in the military,
it’s important to understand that “just because” you filed and were
denied does not mean that your case cannot succeed, as an experienced
legal team can turn your denial into a grant of benefits.

Orthopedic Injuries

Injuries of the spine, neck, knees, hips, and other joints are
unfortunately common in the military.  The truth is that being in the
military can be a dangerous occupation—Aside from the injuries caused
by war, there are a plethora of injuries that Veterans sustain in
war-related and peacetime service activities.

Whether it’s an injury during training that never healed, or lifting
something as part of your routine duties in your MOS, an injury at the
age of 20 where you are prescribed Motrin and light duty for a week can
become quite troubling in your 40’s and beyond through the normal
process of the injured areas degenerating over time.

It’s important to deal with counsel that has a network of physicians
that are practice with Veteran’s orthopedic injuries.  And it’s not
just about words on a page… it’s about what the doctor’s opinion
actually states, and the wording within the opinion, making it critical
to deal with advocates that are highly experienced in VA law.  Without
careful work and thoughtful consideration of your claims by a team of
competent professionals, your chances of a good outcome are
dramatically reduced.

Chronic Diseases Acquired while in service

When you sign up for your military career, there is a trade-off.  The
government OWNS you… they can assign you to do anything, and go
anywhere in the world at their whim.  As part of that tradeoff, they
OWN you for the good and the bad.

If you are diagnosed with a chronic illness (i.e. that endures for a
long time) such as diabetes, heart conditions, cancer, mental health
conditions, or had symptoms of the beginning of those conditions (that
are often left undiagnosed while still in active duty), under current
law, the VA MUST pay you benefits.

It’s important to deal with competent counsel to help gather the
correct evidence and make legal argument as to why you are due
benefits.

Vaccine Injuries

Soldiers are facing health complications from the mandatory COVID 19
vaccines for service members.  As we learn more about the vaccine,
certain health complications are dramatically higher amongst those
vaccinated military members.  Research points to increased
miscarriages, myocarditis and other heart problems, blood clots, and
even death.

While this body of law is expected to develop over the next year or two
as major litigation exposes the injuries suffered as a result of the
COVID vaccine, it’s important to file your claim NOW so that when those
changes are eventually implemented in the law, your case is already
matriculating through the system.

Toxic Chemical Exposure/Agent Orange/Radiation

If you know or suspect you have been exposed to toxic herbicides such
as Agent Orange, radiation, burn pits, or other toxic substances and
have health issues as a result, it’s imperative, now more than ever, to
seek competent counsel regarding your claim(s).

A poorly prosecuted case at the beginning reduces your odds of a win on
appeal, especially with new provisions under the law.  Competent legal
counsel can guide you through the process to avoid the pitfalls that
may jeopardize your case.

If you have been denied for VA benefits for exposure to toxic
substances or radiation, you have only ONE YEAR from the date of your
denial to appeal your claim.
