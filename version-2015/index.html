        <p>We also have several veterans ready, willing and able to give a testimonial. Don't take our word for it... talk to fellow veterans who have received benefits!</p>

        <p>CALL 704-543-2294 TO SCHEDULE YOUR FREE CONSULTATION</p>

        <h2>Feel Like You're "Locked Out" of Your Benefits?</h2>
        <p>The VA Disability process can be daunting. The truth is, it is quite complicated. The difference between getting the benefits you deserve, or being "locked out" of the benefits you should be receiving is only a matter of knowing which key to use.</p>
        <p>Our staff is highly trained and skilled... Our staff consists of a former VA Ratings Officer, a former Army Nurse, two experienced case coordinators, and a full time attorney highly trained in Veterans Benefits and Law.</p>
        <p>Our Staff members are former veterans. Some run a non-profit Veteran's organization and have helped literally thousands of veterans over their careers. In a typical week, our staff members teach veterans at free educational seminars, field questions, and meet more formally with veterans in our offices or in phone conferences to develop good, sound cases to get our veterans APPROVED.</p>
        <p>We routinely work with veterans who have been denied numerous times and over many years. The VA disability application process is full of landmines... Our former VA Ratings Officers and attorneys know the "ropes", and are committed to helping you navigate through a maze of laws and forms to help you get the benefits you need and deserve.</p>
