veterans that have been previously denied, regardless of whether you
applied yourself, using a veteran's organization, or another law firm.
 Let our expert staff review your case... IT'S FREE.
CALL NOW for your FREE consultation at 704-543-2294.  Our expert staff
is dedicated to you.
We also have several veterans ready, willing and able to give a
testimonial.  Don't take our word for it... talk to fellow veterans who
have received benefits!
Done right.  The first time.

Feel Like You're "Locked Out" of Your Benefits?
The VA Disability process can be daunting.  The truth is, it is quite
complicated.  The difference between getting the benefits you deserve,
or being "locked out" of the benefits you should be receiving is only a
matter of knowing which key to use.
Our staff is highly trained and skilled... Our staff consists of a
former VA Ratings Officer, a former Army Nurse, two experienced case
coordinators, and a full time attorney highly trained in Veterans
Benefits and Law.
Our Staff members are former veterans.  Some run a non-profit Veteran's
organization and have helped literally thousands of veterans over their
careers.  In a typical week, our staff members teach veterans at free
educational seminars, field questions, and meet more formally with
veterans in our offices or in phone conferences to develop good, sound
cases to get our veterans APPROVED.
We routinely work with veterans who have been denied numerous times and
over many years.  The VA disability application process is full of
landmines... Our former VA Ratings Officers and attorneys know the
"ropes", and are committed to helping you navigate through a maze of
laws and forms to help you get the benefits you need and deserve.
